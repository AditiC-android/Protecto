# Protecto
School shootings have become the new reality of the United States. Thousands of students, teachers, and parents are living their lives in fear. Protecto works to strengthen the communication between schools and the police, make our students more aware of school shootings, and allows our school staff to be more aware of their schoolsâ€™ situation.
